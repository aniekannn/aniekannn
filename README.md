Hi! I'm a Sophomore in Texas A&M's College of Engineering and studying Electrical Engineering & Mathematics. At Texas A&M, I'm an Undergraduate Researcher at Digital Manufacturing and Distribution Lab, a member of the Software subteam of the 6-DOF Prosthetic Ankle project, and a co-project manager of Aggie Agenda. I'm really interested in Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Computer Science.

In my free time, I like to read (currently: Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin), bike, and listen to music (a lot of U2 & Freddie Gibbs right now). Check out someone of my projects and learn more about me at [aniekan-ekanem.com](https://aniekan-ekanem.com)
